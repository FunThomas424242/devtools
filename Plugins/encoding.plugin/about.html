 <p>

This plugin is a encoding converter. It should help to convert files of any encoding into another
encoding format. At now we only support the UTF-8 encoding for output format. 
</p><p>
This plugin is using a third party library wich can detect the input encoding automatically. But 
the autodetect is a little bit heuristic and so it can't 100% dectect the correct input encoding.
Please test it before you will use the plugin!	
</p><p>
This plugin is using a external jar file wich has no license. All other parts of the plugin are 
developed in terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. In the next section the term library 
stands for this plugin.
